# Project 0
Hi!
My name is Federico Puleio. I'm a 28 year-old argentinian, and i will try to describe a bit what is going on in this project0 that i made.
Is my very first time doing any type of programming project, and it was a really good experience so far.
I'm a tattoo apprentice, so i tought it could be a good idea to share a bit of what i like to do, some of the different techniques that exist so far, and also the history and some stories about the origin of tattoing.
I started creating 4 different .html files that will lead you to the home page first, where you can choose between Tattoo origins, Tattoo styles, and Personal Designs.
For the main page i wanted it to be simple, but functional. It has a big heading with 3 buttons that link to the next 3 pages. I used one type of bootstrap button with different colours.   
Next, i used a bootstrap grid model to include the tattoo origins page's content, with 2 headings on top.
After that, it was Tattoo Styles page's turn. First, i used a table to describe some of the different styles that we can find in the tattoo world, with a link at the end that takes you to each example that i selected, with a short description and also a link to each artist's instagram account.
Finally, i wanted to humbly show some of the things i like to do, with some of the latest drawings i made. Bellow that, i put a link to pinterest, in case you feel like getting a tattoo!
Every page but the home page have a "Home" button, linking you back to the main page.
Regarding to the code, i used bootstrap 4 and as i wanted the page to be responsive, i included a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors as bootstrap website says.
I put the tattoo styles page's images in an ordered list, using id and class tags to separate them.
The table is taken from bootstrap too. The problem appeared when i saw the website on my phone. It wasn't responsive. So i looked for a css style that changes the behaviour to be responsive.
The same happened with the paragraphs that i used as short description of the style examples, so i made a media query to change the content to be even shorter for mobile devices.
I used variables to determinate colors around the page, nesting to give some style to headings number 2 and 3, and inheritance to change a bit the style of the tattoo origins page's content.
Thank you for reading and for your time.
If everything goes well, see you in the next lesson!

Best regards,

Federico Puleio
